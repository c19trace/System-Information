# System-Information

C19 Trace is a system composed of 3 parts. 
The mobile application provides students with the means to register their attendance on campus and to check if any of these attendances have exposed them to COVID-19.
The back-end server maintains a database of students and student attendances, monitoring and updating the COVID-19 exposure status of both.
And the administration server provides a view into the back-end server's database as well as providing COVID-19 related statistics.
